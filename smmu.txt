                          SMMU 'Smack My Marine Up'
                    an MBF Port by Simon Howard 'Fraggle'
           http://fraggle.tsx.org/  || sfraggle@sfrag.free-online.co.uk

                version 3.02 'birthday beta' 25/7/99

NB: This Version is a *BETA*. Some of the new features are incomplete
    and/or do not work properly. Please bear this in mind and recognise
    the fact that I am *NOT* responsible for any damage done by this
    program

Editing
~~~~~~~
There are several new editing features in smmu. Look in smmuedit.txt for
more details.

Batman Doom Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Batman Doom Port is notoriously unreliable on certain ports, particularly
ZDoom. I had some problem running it under SMMU at first, but I was later
able to fix the problem and it now runs apparently fine. If you have any
problem, please contact me!

Netgame support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some new netgame options:
 * Deathmatch III: add -trideath parameter to command line
 * ability to set name, colour
 * 'server' computer is green player (not actually client-server
   network model... yet)
 * built in serial communications with console commands:
        - nullmodem: connect over a null-modem cable
        - answer: tell the modem to wait for a call
        - dial <number> : dial someone else waiting for a call
        - com <port> : set the comport used
 * map changable from console, server computer can set certain
   'server' variables: sv_bfglook, sv_allowmlook 
 * built in pop-up frag counter
 * One computer crashing does not slow all the others to a crawl:
   the console and menu still run even if the game itself does not
 * Support for Doom Legacy skins
 * Obituaries
 * WORKING netgames with this version

New stuff
~~~~~~~~~
 * Chasecam: use the chasecam console command
 * Load Doom I wads under Doom II through mapping Doom I textures to Doom II
   textures
 * Walk-cam allows you to walk around in demos which are running
 * Half-life style crosshair which lights up when pointed at enemies
 * Swirling quake-style water effect.
 * Support for doom legacy skins (use 'listskins' command to list skins,
   'skin' to change your skin)
 * Left handedness
 * Fully functional and reliable (I think) 'addfile' command to dynamically
   load wads
 * Walkcam: walk around in demos

How to try out the new stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * At the console, type 'chasecam on' to see the new chasecam. Wander
   around a bit, then type 'chasecam off' again to turn it off (see how
   it moves back into the player.. wow!)
 * Half-life style crosshair. Type 'crosshair 1' at the console. A red
   crosshair should appear. Now point the crosshair at an enemy. It
   goes green. Useful in the dark =).
 * Find a spot of water somewhere (eg. the outdoor bit in MAP01).
   Now go to the console, type 'r_swirl 1'. The water changes to a swirling
   effect similar to Quake. Developers can also use this in their wads.
   See smmuedit.txt.
 * Get a skins wad off the Internet (eg. The Imp Skin available from my
   page -- http://fraggle.tsx.org/). Now, run 'smmu -file <wad file name>'
   Go into a level and turn on the chasecam (type 'map map01; chasecam on')
   Now, at the console type 'listskins'. If you have done things right,
   you should see a list of skins: 'marine' followed by 'imp' or whatever.
   Pick a skin (other than 'marine') and type 'skin <skin name>'. Your
   player should change to an imp (or whatever you chose)
 * Make sure the chasecam is off, then type 'lefthanded 1' at the console.
   Your gun should flip the other way and appear left handed!
 * Pick a wad file from the dos prompt. Now run smmu. When the title screen
   appears, activate the console and type 'addfile <wad file name>'. A
   loading box appears, and a few seconds later you are returned to the
   console. Now press escape to bring up the menu, and start a new game.
   The new wad has been loaded and you should start on the first level of the
   new wad.
 * Load a wad, get a demo playing. Now at the console type 'walkcam 1'. You
   can walk around inside the demo while it plays!

Problems with netgames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a slight possibility that netgames may not work properly. If
you have a problem, you may find that reliability of the netgame will
improve if you copy the same smmu.cfg file onto both (or all) computers
you are playing it on.

*PLEASE NOTE*
At the start of smmu netgames, you will see a message
'please wait: sending game data' or 'please wait: receiving game data'.
Your game has *NOT* crashed. It make take quite a long time to transfer
the game data, possibly up to 20 seconds. Please be patient. I have a
solution to this which can significantly speed up the transfer, but it
is rather unstable at the moment.

How to play with a modem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The serial/modem support is still rather dodgy, but it does actually
work now. However, you are more likely to get consistancy failures
than if an external program is used. If you have problems, try the
following checklist:

 * Make sure you have selected the right com port (use the console
        'com' variable)
 * Try following guidelines from the previous section 'problems with
        netgames'
 * Make sure you have not started any new games or allowed any demos to
   start. Start SMMU, and when the title screen appears, bring down the
   console and type 'endgame' to drop to a full-screen console. Now proceed
   with starting the game.
 * If even the previous point does not cure it, go one step further and do
   not even bring down the console. Quickly type the commands to establish
   the game (be careful not to leave it too long or a demo will start)

Console
~~~~~~~
A list is available in smmu by typing 'cmdlist': i'm sure you can
figure most of them out. Alternatively, try smmucons.txt
