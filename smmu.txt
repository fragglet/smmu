                 version 3.10 'FraggleScript Beta' 16/10/99

[1] What is SMMU ?
------------------
SMMU is based on the 'MBF' port by Lee Killough. It includes all the
features of normal Doom, plus 'Boom' additions and also all the main
features of 'MBF'. In addition to these, SMMU includes its own
unique features which have been added.

The original philosophy behind SMMU was to provide better multiplayer
options for doom on top of the backbone of MBF. However, I now see
the main aim of SMMU as being to add new and original features to
the game, including multiplayer features, while maintaining original
compatibility and retaining the 'fun and flavour' of the original
doom.

[1-1] List of features
----------------------
New features added in SMMU:

        * FraggleScript -- fully featured programming language for
                level authors
        * Dynamic loading of WAD files once the game has begun.
        * Inbuilt serial communications: you no longer need to exit
                the game to start a new game over a serial link.
                Similarly built-in TCP/IP networking to come soon.
        * Level 'lumps' to define names of levels, par times etc.
        * Walkcam to let you walk around inside playing demos,
                even when paused.
        * Game / Environment seperation: if a netgame freezes, the
          menu and console will still run at the same speed.
        * Support for 'unfinished' boom sound flags - kill all
          sound in sector, kill sound in sector due to moving
        * 'Half-life style' lightup crosshair
        * 'Rippling' quake-style water effect for level creators
        * Extra multiplayer options: player name, player colour
                (including new colours), deathmatch 3
        * Chasecam
        * Fully functional command console: change game variables,
                activate features etc.
        * Support for Doom Legacy skins.
        * Y-shearing look up/down -- NO JUMPING
        * Zooming


[2] FraggleScript
-----------------
FraggleScript has begun to be implemented. In fact its more-or-less finished.
Try smmutest.wad or look thru smmutest.fs to see it in action :)

        [... smmu.txt to be completed ...]

[3] Netgames
------------

[3-1] How do I play netgames ?
------------------------------
To play over a network (ie. IPX), you need ipxboom.exe which comes with the
BOOM distribution. Then just type:

        ipxboom -exe smmu ... [other options]

To play over a serial link is different (and still rather experimental).
SMMU has built in serial comms. To use this, first go to the console and
type 'endgame' to get a full-screen console. Then type the following:

        com (com port to use)
        nullmodem

Do this on both computers and it should start right into a netgame. Also,
you can play using a modem in a similar way:

    on the computer to be called:
        com (com port of modem)
        answer
    on the computer to call the person:
        com (com port of modem)
        dial (phone number)

The 

in-built TCP/IP comms is to come soon.

[3-2] "Sending game data" message
---------------------------------
At the start of smmu netgames, you will see a message
'please wait: sending game data' or 'please wait: receiving game data'.
Your game has *NOT* crashed. It make take quite a long time to transfer
the game data, possibly up to 20 seconds. Please be patient. I have a
solution to this which can significantly speed up the transfer, but it
is rather unstable at the moment, and so is not included.

[3-3] What extra netgame features does SMMU add?
------------------------------------------------
Loads!

 * Deathmatch III: add -trideath parameter to command line
 * ability to set name, colour
 * 'server' computer is green player (not actually client-server
   network model... yet)
 * map changable from console, server computer can set certain
   'server' variables: bfglook, allowmlook 
 * pop-up frag counter
 * One computer crashing does not slow all the others to a crawl:
   the console and menu still run even if the game itself does not
 * Support for Doom Legacy skins
 * Obituaries
 * WORKING netgames with this version

[4] Frequently asked questions
------------------------------
Q. Uh? Where are all these new options I've heard about? I dont see any of
   them in the menus? Is it all a lie?
A. The SMMU menu system is behind the rest of the developments brought by
   SMMU. A new menu will be coming soon which should allow access to all
   the new features. Until now, you can do most of what you want to do
   through the console.

Q. What are all these new editing features I've heard about and what the
   hell is "FraggleScript"?
A. SMMU adds many new editing features. Some of these are shown in
   smmutest.wad. FraggleScript is the fully-featured built-in language
   that developers can use in their levels.

Q. Couldn't you be bothered to make a proper demo map?
A. I'm not a level editor. The level smmutest.wad which is included is
   simply the level I've been using to develop FraggleScript in. Afterglow
   should be making a proper demo map soon.

Q. Your port rocks me down! Where can I get the sources?
A. The sources are avaiable from my website at http://fraggle.tsx.org/

Q. Does batman doom run under SMMU?
A. It should do. I had some initial problems trying to run batman doom under
   SMMU but quickly fixed these.

Q. Why isn't SMMU GPL yet?
A. I will make it GPL as soon as I can. SMMU is based on MBF by Lee
   Killough, so I can't make SMMU GPL until MBF is too. Lee has suggested
   that he probably will make it GPL, so it shouldnt be long.

Q. This is a nice port, but what more are you going to do with it?
A. Here is a short list of things to be done in the future with SMMU:
        * Proper graphics for console backdrop etc.
        * Start map (Afterglow is working on it, should be in soon)
        * A new menu
        * TCP/IP netgames
        * Client-server networking
        * Linux port
