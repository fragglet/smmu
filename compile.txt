SMMU Compiling Info
-------------------

DJGPP
-----

To configure for djgpp, run djgpp.bat to setup config.h and the Makefile.

* You _need_ the Allegro libraries in order to compile.
* SMMU uses libsocket for TCP/IP support through a winsock backdoor. This
  is available at http://libsocket.tsx.org/. Alternatively, you can build
  a version without TCP/IP support by editing the makefile and removing
  the '-DTCPIP' switch.

Cygwin
------

Run the configure script in bash to setup the compile

* The cygwin version now has working DirectDraw and DirectSound. To take
  advantage of this, you need to install the cygwin DirectX headers. SMMU
  will still compile without these but you will have no fullscreen or
  sound.
* If you install libX you can have a windows xdoom binary!

Linux
-----
* The new SMMU module-based graphics code means that you can compile a
  version with support for both X Window and svgalib, although you can
  also build a version with only support for one, of course.
* You can compile the SMMU dedicated server by typing 'make dedicated'.
  This will make an executable named 'dedserv' which will act as a lone
  dedicated server program for netgames.

Source for utilities included:

* add_fs to add FraggleScript programs into wads
* a rewritten version of swantbls which should work on all platforms
  and also has support for the SMMU swirling water effect.
