SMMU Compiling Info
-------------------

DJGPP
-----
* You _need_ the Allegro libraries in order to compile.
* SMMU uses libsocket for TCP/IP support through a winsock backdoor. This
  is available at http://libsocket.tsx.org/. Alternatively, you can build
  a version without TCP/IP support by editing the makefile and removing
  the '-DTCPIP' switch.
* There have been some problems with m_fixed.h and the 'improved' assembler
  code added there by Lee Killough in MBF. I have included a copy of the
  old boom assembly code in case you have problems with it.

Linux
-----
* There is as yet no linux sound support.
* The new SMMU module-based graphics code means that you can compile a
  version with support for both X Window and svgalib, although you can
  also build a version with only support for one, of course.
* You can compile the SMMU dedicated server by typing 'make dedicated'.
  This will make an executable named 'dedserv' which will act as a lone
  dedicated server program for netgames.
* The sources for SMMUSERV are included here which is the server lookup
  program SMMU uses for internet play.

Source for utilities included:

* add_fs to add FraggleScript programs into wads
* a rewritten version of swantbls which should work on both DOS and Linux
  and also has support for the SMMU swirling water effect.
